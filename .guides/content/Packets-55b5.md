Large objects have always been broken down into their component parts when they have been transported over large distances. And then reconstructed at their destination.
If there are lots of parts then they are usually numbered.

Have a look at this video of London Bridge being broken down into numbered parts for its journey to America.

Just imagine the problems if the separate parts (packets) weren’t numbered.

In a similar way, data is broken down into packets which are reassembled by the receiving computer and each of the packets must be labelled so that the computer knows the order in which they have to be reassembled.

The British computer scientist, Donald Davies, working at the National Physical Laboratory in the 1960s, developed an efficient method for the transmission of data packets across networks and first used the name ‘**packet switching**’.

In a packet switching network the two devices do not have a dedicated line as you would for a telephone conversation. The different packets can travel by different routes, along different lines, from network to network until they reach their destination where they are reassembled.
